## Semantic HTML 
Semantic HTML helps screen readers and other assistive tech get useful info on the structure of a website.
### Semantic Tags
- use only __one__ `h1` heading per page
- do not skip heading levels
- user elements like `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article` etc to structure pages (instead of putting everything into a `div`)
### ARIA
- __ARIA__ is short for **A**ccessible **R**ich **I**nternet **A**pplications. A set of attributes and roles that help make websites more accessible
### ARIA Roles 
ARIA roles are attributes that can be added to an HTML element and give semantic meaning to those elements. There are __six different categories__:
	1. __Document structure roles__ like `note` or `tooltip` describe the structure of a section of content
	2. __Widget roles__ like `slider` or `menu` describe the type of elements presented on a website
	3. __a comprehensive list of ARIA roles and their categories can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles)__
