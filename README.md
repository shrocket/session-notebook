# WebDev Notebook/Notespace

## This is a note-taking space I will attempt to use when reviewing every handout and challenge from the bo-web-23-4 neue fische boot camp.

If this notespace is created according to plan, every "session" will have 
- a markdown file of notes
- a link in this README

(I can't imagine I'll keep up with it, and the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, but let's see what happens.)
