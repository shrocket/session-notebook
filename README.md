# WebDev Notebook/Notespace

## This is a note-taking space I will attempt to use when reviewing every handout and challenge from the bo-web-23-4 neue fische boot camp.

If this notespace is created according to plan, every "session" will have 
- a markdown file of notes
- a link in this README

(I can't imagine I'll keep up with it, and the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, but let's see what happens.) 

This repo was initially created on 2023-10-25 and abandoned pretty much the same day.

Today is 2024-06-26, and I'm restarting, dammit.
