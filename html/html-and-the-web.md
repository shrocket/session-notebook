# HTML and the web

### HTML tag attributes

Some elements require some more information in order to work properly. This information is
specified via attributes, for example:

- the source of an image
  ```html
  <img src="logo.png" alt="The logo of the company." />
  ```
- the destination of an anchor element
  ```html
  <a href="https://example.com"> click me </a>
  ```
- the type of an input element
  ```html
  <input type="date" />
  ```

> detailed information about elements and corresponding attributes.

### Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML elements not only divide the content of the web page into distinct parts, but also
describe the function or purpose of the elements. This has two major benefits:

- The HTML becomes more understandable for other developers
- Accessibility tools and search engines can interpret the website

Therefore, one should use semantic HTML elements whenever possible.

### Nesting HTML elements

Nesting groups elements together in a meaningful way. The element containing the other elements is
called the **parent element**, which contains one or more **child elements**.

The following cases are typical examples of nested elements:

- ```html
  <ul>
    <li>first item</li>
    <li>second item</li>
    <li>third item</li>
  </ul>
  ```
- ```html
  <article>
    <h2>Some headline</h2>
    <p>I am a paragraphâ€¦</p>
    <a href="https://www.github.com">a link to another website</a>
  </article>
  ```
- ```html
  <button>
    <img src="arrow.svg" />
    <span> submit </span>
  </button>
  ```
